    // The BookService class is responsible for getting the book data from the repository
    // The BookService class is dependent on the IBookRepository interface (dependency injection)
    // The BookService class implements the IBookService interface (contract)
    // We are using dependency injection to inject the IBookRepository interface into the BookService class
    // Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows us to inject the dependencies of a class from the outside without instantiating them inside the class
    // This makes the class more modular (modular means that the class is easier to test and maintain because its separated out into its own thing)  
    // We do not inject the BookRepository class directly into the BookService class because we want to be able to mock the repository in our unit tests
    // If we inject the BookRepository class directly into the BookService class, we would not be able to mock the repository in our unit tests because the BookRepository class is a concrete class (not an interface) and we should not be testing the actual implementation of the BookRepository class in our unit tests
